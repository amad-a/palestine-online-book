Khalo Stawri,<br>
I really miss you lots<br>
And you are always in my thoughts<br>
I pray and pray<br>
Every single day<br>
That you were still here<br>
But you're not, and that causes a tear<br>
However, I know you're happier in heaven now<br>
with God and your mom and dad<br>
So I'll try not to be so sad!<br>
But now what I want to do Is say:<br>
I will always and forever love you!<br>
Well Khalo Stawri I wanted to let you know that you were the best uncle you
could ever be and I'm grateful that God sent someone like you on this earth! I
want to thank you for everything and especially for loving me so much...I know
that you did because you always said," I love you more than I love
myself!" Well same goes for you!<br>
Well I'll always be missing you and your wonderful letters, I loved receiving
them! Well, I'll see you in heaven, when the time comes but until then remember:<br>
You're always in my heart forever and I love you dearly.<br>
Watch over all of us please<br>
Love you,<br>

Stawri<br>
"I love you always forever, near or far we'll always be together!<br>
Would you know my name and would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?"<br>
I know we both want the answer to be "yes" but is it really? All these
questions will remain unanswered until that day. I have your necklace you used
to always wear but I don't know if I should be the one to wear it, do I deserve
it? At least now we can talk whenever we want and we don't need to worry about
long distance charges. Thank you for the<br>
Easter gift. I love you so,so,so,so,so, much.<br>
"So kiss me and smile for me please tell me that you'll wait for me!<br>
Love you always,<br>

"Even if the stars don't shine<br>
if the heavens burst<br>

only when I die I'll be by your side<br>
And I love you always"<br>
God has given and taken away a person who has touched my life in more ways then
I could express!<br>
Khalo-words could never do justice to how much you mean to me!<br>
p.s. Tell tata and seedo I love them! And make sure God gives you all the
messages I send! Till we meet again<br>
I love you forever,<br>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4">It is simply hard to believe that
Stawri is not there waiting for me at the steps to our house in Damascus Gate,
the next time I visit Jerusalem. It is hard for me to believe that he is not
standing right now outside the Exchange Shop in Damascus Gate. It is hard for me
to believe that Jerusalem is the same with out Stawri. It is hard for me to
believe that Stawri is not there this Easter time in Jerusalem. It is hard for
me to believe that Stawri is not walking in his usual hurry pace in the
Christian Quarter greeting everyone like a victorious hero who has just returned
from a won battle. <br>
My Family and I will always miss him greatly. May God rest his soul in Eternal
Peace. </font></p>
