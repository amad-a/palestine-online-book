<br><a name="about"></a><b><font color="#000066">About the Women's Empowerment
Project (WEP):</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">The Women's Empowerment Project (WEP)
forms part of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme. The ultimate
goal of the WEP , is to improve the quality of life of women victims of
violence, their families and community, through strengthening of local
rehabilitation, education and training facilities. The ongoing deterioration
of the socio-economic and political situation in the Gaza Strip has lead
to an increase in violence, specially against women and children. This
also lead to an increased demand by women for the WEP services. The WEP
has responded by expanding its range of viable services. At the present
time the WEP offers facilities allowing for women to be trained in vocational
and income generating skills, while at the same time providing psychological
and legal counseling, and education in self development, women's health,
social and legal issues. The WEP has three center, in Gaza, Rafah and Beach
Camp. The further plans include the replication of these centers in the
middle camps area due to their present lack of services.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Using a Training of Trainers approach
will help to develop a pool of&nbsp; female community leaders, working
as educators and mentors within the community.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Currently, training courses are being
developed for women who were unable to complete their secondary schooling,
and networks are being established with local policewomen to cooperate
in a training course which will increase their skills and awareness in
dealing with vulnerable sectors of the community.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Since its establishment, the project
has focused on the community approach. Workshops, public meetings and support
groups are organized beside lectures from within or outside the center.
The project philosophy and believes that a woman school not be considered
just as separate unit, but should be dealt with the family as a whole.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">Being conscious of the importance
of gender awareness within the framework of training of trainers and education,
the project also realized that this issue is not exclusive to women, so
efforts will be made to regularly monitor the impact of these courses on
male members of families, and by extension, the broader community.</font></div>

<div dir="LTR"><font color="#000066">In 1997 the WEP established a resource
unit and started to collect information in order to establish a data base
concerning violence against women in the community. As the involvement
of women in the development process is essential, these information collected
by the resource center will be helpful in designing future research.</font></div>
