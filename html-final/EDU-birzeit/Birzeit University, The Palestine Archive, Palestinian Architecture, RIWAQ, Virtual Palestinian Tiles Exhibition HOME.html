<h2>Virtual Exhibition of Palestinian Tiles</h2>
<b>
<p>On this page and the pages to follow, 
representative samples of traditional floor tile 
patterns are presented. </p>

<p>This work is taken 
from Riwaq's <em>Revival of the Use of Traditional 
Floor Tiles</em> project. The objective of this project 
is twofold. On the one hand it aims at 
artistically
documenting the numerous tile designs that 
were once predominant in Palestine. On the 
other hand it aims at exploring the feasibility of 
reproducing these tiles. These tiles, such as the ones which form the background to this page and which 
were extensively used, are sadly no longer 
produced.</p>


<p>For decades, Palestinians, mainly in the 
cities, used to adorn the exterior as well as the 
interiors of their buildings. This grand 
ornamentation was not only beautiful but also 
prestigious. Craftsman used a wide variety of 
decorated (carved) columns, arches, lintels, 
window and door frames. Coloured floor tiles 
had a complimentary effect. In many cases, 
the floor of each room of a building had its own 
unique pattern.</p><p> 

</p><p>RIWAQ wishes to express its gratitude to the following individuals who participated in the documentation of the old floor tile patterns:</p>

<p>Hussam Naser (Project Coordinator); Lena Sobh (Tracer); Solana Nimats (Painter); Lama Shamia, Ghada Khalaf and Du'a Wadi (Pattern Tracers - Ramallah Area); and Salaam Rihan, Sana' Birawi and Hania Masoud (Pattern Tracers - Nablus Area). RIWAQ would also like to thank <em>Groupe Development</em> for its partial sponsorship of this project.</p>
